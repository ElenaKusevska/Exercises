When using Python apt-get and PIP

apt-get installs in /usr/lib (on ubuntu 18.04)
PIP installs in /home/elena/.local (on ubuntu 18.04)

Add shebang path (#!/usr/bun/Python3.x) when using Ubuntu 18.04 because
Python 2 is the default in Ubuntu 18.04

Also make sure that PIP downloads with --user. Though it appears this
is default for PIP3 on Ubuntu 18.04. 

Then make sure /home/elena/.local is added to the PATH, because this is the
directory that PIP3/PIP with --user installs to. And also, that in 
/home/elena/.local there are separate python3.x and python2.7 directories, 
and that the desired package is installed in python3.x.

Also, PIP will install dependencies without asking, regardless of whether they
are already installed in /usr/lib or not. So maybe it's best to just use pip 
whenever possible and never use apt-get if possible. So that you don't have 
multiple versions. For example, when you install numpy, scipy, and matplotlib
for the first time, just use PIP.
