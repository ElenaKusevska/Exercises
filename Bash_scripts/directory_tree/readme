Script to go to every single directory in a directory tree and do something.
I.e. make some changes to some files, delete some files etc.

For example. In the directory where the Gaussian calculations are, go
in every directory and delete the .chk and .fchk files so that the
directory with the calculaions  becomes lighter and the results can be 
more easily shared by uploading or sending by e-mail. 

Or check that all reported energies are correct etc. 

Or for example, in c++ remove all files in every directory, so that
you don't have to call rm -r from bash
