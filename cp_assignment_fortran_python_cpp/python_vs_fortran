1) The for (do) loop (1, n)
   in python it counts from 1 to n, but not including n
   in Fortran it counts from 1 to n, including n.

2) Array (list) elements
   The first element of a list in Python is array(0), ending at array(n-1),
   or its array (-n), ending at array(-1)
   The first element of an array in Fortran is array(1), unless specified
   otherwise

3) ending a loop and a function prematurely. Say you are looping over 
numbers until you find an answer in a function. When you find the
right answer you want to terminate the loop and the function
prematurely. In Fortran, you would do exit first, to leave the loop
and then end function to leave the function. In python, you just type
return(arguments) in the loop, and the loop and the function will
terminate.
